# Simple Docker Example

This repo contains the source code that is used in my Intro To Docker article on dev.to: https://dev.to/danko56666/intro-to-docker-3p42

Please refer to my article to see what commands to try out.

Do note, this is a very basic Docker example, it's not meant to be used in a production workflow or anything like that.
